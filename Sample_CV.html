                    languages and frameworks every day<br/><br/><strong>Overview</strong><br/>I'm self-driven and very
                    energetic person, I like to be dominant in the environment I work in and like to be responsible and
                    very active part of the project or a company. I dislike any negative energy around team and myself
                    and I dislike any type of behavior that could jeopardize or affect any individual in my surrounding.
                    I believe that having empathy and being able to have more then one perception is a key element in
                    understanding yourself and the world around you.<br/><br/>My actions and opinions are based on facts
                    and arguments, I’m not a stubborn but rather person who will question anything you state or do,
                    therefore, I like to base my knowledge and experience on proof, not on possibility and uncertainty.
                    Stating an opinion based on assumptions and lack of understandment or research is very dangerous and
                    usually ends up in blind alley. That being said, my technical knowledge is based on understandment
                    and not patterns which is very usual way of programmers performing their work today.<br/><br/>If you
                    are open and smart entrepreneur, if you are a person with goals, energy, passion, empathy and
                    everything else that  "normal" homo sapiens should naturally possess, I'm willing to talk, work and
                    hang out with you.<br/><br/>I'm a real geek and I do technology cause it fulfils my life, not
                    because of digits and their range. Your digits will never drive me to your company, your
                    environment, project and people will.<br/><br/>I'm a guy who learns and expands every day, I do not
                    own eternal wisdom like some people I meet, I'm not a genius nor I'm the best programmer or
                    technical person on this planet. The thing that I'm good at whatsoever and hard to beat is
                    assimilation in organisations and embracing new technologies and habits on the go, this is where I'm
                    really hard to beat.
